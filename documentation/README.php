/* 
 * We have changed our functionality considerably from what was proposed in our assignment 1 writeup so we 
 * decided to quickly state these changes here. 
 * 
 * Admin pages are only accessible from the home page at the moment.
 * 
 * The torturer tab displays a list of planets in need of torturing. You can click the planet for more details on
 * who you can torture and even rate that planet based on how much you enjoyed torturing there.
 * 
 * The jedihunt tab now shows a list of wanted Jedi with the Jedi's picture, last known location and a brief dscription.
 * The user may add to this list any Jedi he wants dead. 
 * 
 * The tombs tab now displays a list of all planets containing tombs you can explore. You can click on each planet
 * for a description of which tombs you can find on that particular planet and even leave a comment if you ran into 
 * certain problems in a tomb and want to help out your fellow dark lords. (yeah right! haha this is probably not going to
 * happen)
 * 
 * The blue buttons in the tomb admin are to select that certain planet and to be able to delete 1 or more of the comments
 * for that planet. We have an admin for the comments because you told us to add admin functionality to be able to remove
 * comments in class.
