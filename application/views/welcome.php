    <h1>Welcome to the Dark Lord Hangout!</h1>
    <p>
	Looking for more of those pesky Jedi to hunt? We know they are a nuisance and difficult to find, that is why we have a list of the most wanted Jedi filth for you to hunt at your convenience. You may add to this list at any time!
        If that is not enough, we also have a constantly updated list of Planets in need of your unique torturing abilities. As a Dark Lord of the Sith you are renowned for your cruel torturing ability. If you are bored, why not volunteer and torture some republic scum? You can even rate each planet depending on how it satisfied your needs to make people suffer.
        If all else fails, we thought you may want to do something useful. That is why we also have a list of must-see tombs of ancient Sith Lords who possessed untold powers. Go raiding those tombs in search of the mysterious powers held within and watch your power grow to surpass all of your rivals! You may also add and view comments from other sith lords who may have ran into a road-block on each planet and perhaps learn from their mistakes.
